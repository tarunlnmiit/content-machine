name: antigravity-protocol description: Use this skill ALWAYS whenever the user asks you to write code, modify files, fix bugs, plan features, or do any software development task. Trigger this whenever the user wants efficient execution, low token usage, or mentions "antigravity", "planning mode", "fast path", or complains about you using too many tokens or thinking too much.
Antigravity Protocol: High-Efficiency Coding
This skill instructs Claude to drop high-token conversational behavior and adopt a strict, API-driven, structured approach to software development, prioritizing exact edits and planning over exploratory guessing.

1. Core Directives (Always Follow These)
   Never use generic terminal commands (cat, grep, sed, ls, or complex bash scripts) for file operations or exploration.
   Use specific tools (like view_file, grep_search, replace_file_content) if available, relying on structured JSON/text APIs rather than terminal strings.
   Use chunk-based editing. Never output full file contents. Issue search-and-replace style edits targeting exact line numbers.
   Stop guessing. If a request is ambiguous, do NOT write test scripts to "figure it out". Stop and ask the user a specific question.
   Acknowledge and Act. Do NOT write preambles ("I understand you want to..."). Do NOT summarize step-by-step what you just did unless asked. Output the tool call and state "Done."
2. Process Intent (Determine Mode)
   When the user gives a prompt, categorize it immediately into one of three modes:

Mode A: Investigatory (No output needed except answers)
Trigger: "How does X work?", "Where is Y defined?"
Action: Search the codebase silently. Output only the short answer. Do not create a plan.
Mode B: The Fast Path (Small Changes)
Trigger: "Fix this typo", "Center the button", "Make the background red".
Action:
Retrieve the file context to find exact line numbers.
Issue a precise replace_file_content tool call.
Close turn with "Change applied." No planning required.
Mode C: Strict Planning Mode (Large Tasks)
Trigger: "Add a new page", "Implement auth", "Refactor the database".
Action:
Silent Research: Use specific search tools to trace dependencies. Do NOT modify any code in this phase.
Create Plan: Generate an implementation_plan.md file. Document exact files to touch ([NEW], [MODIFY], [DELETE]) and the logical changes.
Halt for Approval: Stop generating text. Wait for the user to reply "Yes" or approve the plan.
Execute Checklist: Create a task.md checklist ([ ], [/], [x]). Execute the specific file diffs as defined in the plan, updating the checklist as you go without deviating. 3. Tool Hierarchy
Evaluate tools in this strict priority order:

view_file / grep_search (Highest Priority - Targeted reads, low token)
replace_file_content / multi_replace_file_content (For targeted edits)
write_to_file (Only for brand new files)
run_command via terminal (Lowest Priority - Use ONLY for running compiled tests, starting servers, or installing packages. NEVER for edits or file reading).
